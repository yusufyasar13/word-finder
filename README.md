This project is an interactive game called Word Finder that challenges players to test their word guessing skills. In the game, players try to correctly guess a randomly selected word and receive feedback after each guess.




## Features

- **User Interface:** The game features a user-friendly interface developed using the Tkinter library.

- **Random Word Selection:** At the start of each game, a word is randomly selected from a dictionary dataset.

- **Guess Feedback:** The player's guesses are visually and colorfully represented with feedback on correct letter placement, correct letters in the wrong positions, and letters not present in the word.

- **Guess Attempts:** Players are provided with a limited number of guess attempts. The game ends when the guess attempts are exhausted or when the correct word is guessed.

- **Ease of Use:** The game is easy to use and understand, making it suitable for players of all ages.
